# Horizon Zero Dawn UI Menu UI Replica

## Introduction

This project is a replica of a specific part of the menu interface from the popular game Horizon Zero Dawn. The focus of this replica was to recreate the design of the original UI as closely as possible and mimic the exact same keys and mouse interaction behaviours. I have closely observed the game's UI behaviour and did my best to replicate it as close as possible.

## Technologies Used

This project is built with HTML, CSS and Javascript. The project uses Coherent Lab's Interaction Manager library for the key navigation and menu interactions. Additionally ESLint and Prettier have been used to ensure clean and consistent codebase. No bundlers have been used.

## User Guide

The design was provided with the playstation input glyphs but as this is a web project, only keys are used. Having that in mind the project uses the exact same keyboard inputs as in the game.

- Cycle Header Navigation:
  - L1 (Game): E (Keyboard)
  - R1 (Game): Q (Keyboard)
- Exit or Select within the Grid-Like Menu:
  - O (Game): ESC (Keyboard)
  - X (Game): F, ENTER (Keyboard)
